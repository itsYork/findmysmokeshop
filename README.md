# FindMySmokeShop

A simple static website for locating smoke shops and browsing popular smokeâ€‘shop brands. The project contains only HTML, CSS and a small amount of JavaScript for interactive features and for calling the Foursquare Places API.

## Serving the site locally

Since the project consists solely of static files, you can serve it locally with any static file server. If you have Python installed, run the following from the project root:

```bash
python3 -m http.server
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser and navigate to the HTML pages.

## Foursquare API key

The store locator in `locator.html` fetches nearby shops using the Foursquare Places API. The key is defined in [`script.js`](script.js) as the constant `FSQ_API_KEY`:

```javascript
const FSQ_API_KEY = 'YOUR_FOURSQUARE_API_KEY';
```

Replace the placeholder value with your actual API key before using the locator page.

## Login credentials

Brand and retailer logins use credentials stored in the browser's
`localStorage`. This approach is meant only for demo/testing purposes and is
not secure for real accounts.


## Python backend

A minimal Flask application is provided in `app.py` for handling user registration, login and basic subscription storage. It uses SQLite for persistence and exposes JSON API endpoints under `/api/*`.

### Setup

1. Install dependencies in a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the server locally:

```bash
python app.py
```

The application will create `app.db` on first start. API requests can be sent from the frontend using `fetch()`.
